# Variable Delay Line Algorithm for Simulating the Doppler effect created by a moving object
Descreiption of the Project
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project Aims to simulate variable delay line algorithm and an example of how to use it to simulate a moving sound source. The moving object is considered to have a circular motion and then the effect of sound effect is simulated at the center of the circle.

Then the recived signal at two microphone placed at the center of the is used to estimated the TDOA and then align the received signal at two microphones.
The Time difference of arrivals is estimated usinf the correlation based method. for the details of the methods used in estimation you can refer to Spagnolini, Umberto. Statistical Signal Processing in Engineering. John Wiley & Sons, 2018.
