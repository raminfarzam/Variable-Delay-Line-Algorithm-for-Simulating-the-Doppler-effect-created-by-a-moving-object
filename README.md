# Variable-Delay-Line-Algorithm-for-Simulating-the-Doppler-effect-created-by-a-moving-object
Descreiption of the Project
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project Aims to simulate variable delay line algorithm and an example of how to use it to simulate a moving sound source. The moving object is considered to have a circular motion and then the effect of sound effect is simulated at the center of the circle.
Then the recived signal at two microphone placed at the center of the is used to estimated the TDOA and then align the received signal at two microphones.
